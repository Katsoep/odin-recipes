    <p>This Japanese Cucumber and Seaweed Salad is my take on Japanese Sunomono, 
    or vinegar-based dishes, that I love to have as starters or side dishes in 
    Japanese restaurants. I usually love to get a wakame (seaweed) sunomono or cucumber 
    sunomono but for this version, I wanted to fuse the two together.</p>
    <p>You get that crisp bite from the cucumber and added texture & smooth, 
    chewy bite from the rehydrated wakame/seaweed. 
    I use a mandolin sliced to get thin, even cuts of cucumber.</p>

    <p class="text feta">Warm, creamy, and luscious baked feta recipe with bell peppers, tomatoes, herbs, 
    and a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. One of the simplest and most 
    satisfying mezze you'll make! All you need is some crusty bread or homemade 
    pita chips to serve.

    <p class="text feta">This Mediterranean feta recipe is a simple appetizer that takes inspiration 
    from my earlier trip to Greece, where tangy, rich feta is as imperative as olive oil 
    and is used in cooking; or served with seasonal veggies (especially on top of village
    Greek Salad); or as a simple appetizer maybe next to other small plates like 
    sokrdalia (garlic and potato dip) or melitzanosalata (eggplant dip).</p>
